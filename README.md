## Day 2 🚀

- Task 2

# 📁Part A — Theory

## Nine Pillars Understanding

1. **Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks
better for your growth as a system architect?**

**Answer** : 
             AI Development Agents repetitive task ko handle kerta hai jis ay hiigh level structure pay focus kr sakty hai.

2. **Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped
Developer.?**

**Answer** : 
            M-shaped AIDD , Deep coding , AI collaboration and enhance your skills and you use more than one skills .

## Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development

1. **Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?**

**Answer** : 
            Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week because the structure or specification is not define so that give bugs . jab koi short website bana rahy ho for testing vibe coding is very useful, fast.

2. **How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?**

**Answer** : 
             Specification-Driven Development provide all the instruction, structure and also main scalibility and security.

## Architecture Thinking

1. **How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?**

**Answer** :
            Developer in AIDD become architecture-first because the give instructions to AI . they give guidance for structure and designing.
            
2. **Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.**

**Answer** :
             1- Because organized structure.
             2- Maintain scalibility.
             3- AI collaboration.

4. **Main advantage of using AI CLI agents (like Gemini CLI)?**

A. They replace the developer completely

B. Handle repetitive tasks so dev focuses on design & problem-solving ✅

C. Make coding faster but less reliable

D. Make coding optional

5. **What defines an M-Shaped Developer?**

A. Knows little about everything

B. Deep in only one field

C. Deep skills in multiple related domains ✅

D. Works without AI tools

# 🌟 Reflection

*This task highlights how rapidly the developer role is evolving in the AI-Native era. Concepts
like the Nine Pillars, SDD, and Development Agents are not just tools—they represent a
complete shift in how software is planned, built, and maintained.
By practicing architecture-first thinking and learning to collaborate with agents, developers
can grow from code writers into system-level thinkers, eventually becoming M-Shaped
professionals who combine multiple deep skills with intelligent tooling.*
